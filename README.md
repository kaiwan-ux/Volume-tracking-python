Volume controller using Python and OpenCV . This project allows me to adjust my laptop's volume just by moving my fingers! 
 How it works:
ðŸ‘‰ If the distance between my thumb and index finger increases, the volume goes up 
ðŸ‘‰ If the distance decreases, the volume goes down 
Tech stack used: Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Pycaw
